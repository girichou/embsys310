HVAC controller plays a crucial role in any modern household. A high-level function of a controller is to merely monitor the set temperature against the room temperature and throttle the HVAC system. But now a days, considering rising fuel cost and inclination towards reducing carbon footprint, consumers and legislator both demands a controller to achieve this goal with compromising the main goal.  Additionally, users now a days want highly interactive graphical interface to match modern architecture. These additional requirements lead to complex controller design over traditional on-off controller. I have listed below some of development challenges faced by modern controller,

Interface
•	Graphical Interface to display status and configuration menu

Response
•	Very fast user interface response

Troubleshooting
•	Provide error code for root cause analysis
•	Increased communication interface to peripheral sensors

Reliability
•	Highly reliable

Connectivity
•	Support sensor network for more accurate prediction
•	BLE to connect to smart phone
•	Wi-Fi interface for remote setting and monitoring

Memory Space
•	High memory requirement to store profiles, configuration and graphics

Power
•	Low power consumption
•	Battery operated

Features
•	OTA feature upgrades
•	Over the air diagnostics
•	Artificial intelligence to predict the pattern
•	Mesh sensor network
•	Environmental sensor

Security
•	Who can configure the controller?
•	Unauthorized hacking into the system (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc.)

Cost
•	Low cost 
•	Competitive to traditional controller
