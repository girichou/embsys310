HVAC controller plays a crucial role in any modern household. A high-level function of a controller is to merely monitor the set temperature against the room temperature and throttle the HVAC system. But now a days, considering rising fuel cost and inclination towards reducing carbon footprint, consumers and legislator both demands a controller to achieve this goal with compromising the main goal.  Additionally, users now a days want highly interactive graphical interface to match modern architecture. These additional requirements lead to complex controller design over traditional on-off controller. Some of the complex task this controller has to do are listed below,

* Connec to the Wi-Fi router and support asynchronus configurations and also provide status update at regualr internval. Concurrent request can be made amnd reconfiguation request need to be sorted out.
* User accessing the GUI would prefer quick responses otherwise delayed resppnse can cause operational chaos.
* Establish connect to differnt sensors for current state and take necessary action. Commmunication can heepen on differnt buses e.g. analog, SPI, I2C, ADC and 1 Wire. Controller should be able to handle these sensors interfaces.
* Controller also need to conserve the it's own energy consumption.
* 

I have listed below some of development challenges faced by modern controller,

### Interface
* Gaphical Interface to display status and configuration menu

### Response
* Fast user interface response

### Troubleshooting
* Provide error code for root cause analysis
* Increased communication interface to peripheral sensors

### Reliability
* Highly reliable

### Connectivity
*	Support sensor network for more accurate prediction
*	BLE to connect to smart phone
*	Wi-Fi interface for remote setting and monitoring

### Memory Space
*	High memory requirement to store profiles, configuration and graphics

### Power
*	Low power consumption
*	Battery operated

### Features
*	OTA feature upgrades
*	Over the air diagnostics
*	Artificial intelligence to predict the pattern
*	Mesh sensor network
*	Environmental sensor

### Security
*	Who can configure the controller?
*	Unauthorized hacking into the system (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc.)

### Cost
*	Low cost 
* Competitive to traditional controller
